Reaper is a flexible burst job that revolves around gauge and resource management. While Reaper itself has a few strict damage windows, the majority of the rotation can be moved around to align better with mechanics, or to fit into the burst windows of other jobsâ€™ raid buffs. Reaper also has the benefit of being mobile for short periods of time through intelligent usage of its mobility-based abilities and ranged spells.
