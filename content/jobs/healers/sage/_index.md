Sage is a healer specialized in mitigation and shielding. A number of its spells are augmented by Eukrasia, changing their effects and giving the job a unique feel. With a plethora of oGCD heals, ample weave time, and access to the unique healing mechanic Kardia, which heals a target of your choice on every damaging spell, Sage is able to consistently keep damaging while supporting the party. Optimizing a healing plan around these healing tools will allow players to take their damage to the next level while maintaining the safety of the party.
