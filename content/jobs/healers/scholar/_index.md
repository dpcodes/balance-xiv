Scholar is FFXIV's pet healer, coordinating its own healing abilities with those of the fairy. It features a high number of oGCD heals, with some of the more powerful abilities consuming Scholar's most important resource: Aetherflow. While having so many tools can be overwhelming at first, experienced Scholars will find the kit both powerful and flexible, with the ability to efficiently maintain their party while also keeping up their personal damage.
