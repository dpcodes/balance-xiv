Dancer is a job with low personal damage but high contribution to others’ damage through raid buffs. It has “Dances" that require executing the right dance steps in order to perform powerful finishing moves. Outside of Dances, the rotation revolves around a simple combo structure with lots of RNG elements to keep things interesting.
