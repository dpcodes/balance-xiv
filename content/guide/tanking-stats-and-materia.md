# Tanking Stats and Materia

# Stats

## Stat Priority

1. Weapon Damage
2. Main stat (Str/Vit on tanks)
3. Substats

- There are no "Stat weights".
- Weapon Damage almost always comes with main stat increase.
- Higher item level almost always comes with main stat increase.

- Upgrade your gear as often as possible

## Skill Speed (at level 80)

- 2.43s GCD - 1015 SkS
- 2.42s GCD - 1117 SkS
- 2.41s GCD - 1218 SkS
- 2.40s GCD - 1320 SkS
- 2.39s GCD - 1421 SkS
- 2.38s GCD - 1523 SkS
- 2.37s GCD - 1624 SkS
- 2.36s GCD - 1726 SkS

For any other speed, use #bot_spam and the following command:
`!xivmath rspeed X.XX` (replace X.XX with the GCD you want)

## Stat specifics

In general, three out of four tanks can use the same melds.

## Why no DH on WAR?

Warrior is the odd job that avoids Direct Hit due to how Inner Release and Inner Chaos work.

## Why Det melds when DH has priority?

Due to how the stat tiers work, sometimes melding Det is a DPS increase

## Why Tenacity melds when Det has priority?

Sometimes there's nothing else to meld.
Also stat tiering.

# Which substat is the best?

The difference between each substat's effect on output is very small. For example, if you had +2000 DET/+0 DH from gear, switching to +0 DET/+2000 DH would be a 0.52% damage gain. At 12,000 DPS, that would take you to 12,062 DPSâ€”a difference you couldn't detect by eyeballing your logs and one that, in most cases, wouldn't shift you even a single percentile point in performance.

In fact, this difference is so small that with the considerable damage variance in the game (+/- 5% RNG, crit/dh rates), we would not even know it exists had we not reverse engineered the exact damage formula!

**But what's the point of BiS then!?**

Optimizing our damage is desirable, and changing gear or melds is a free and easy way to make minor gains. The idea is simply to highlight that blaming your substat spread is not an alternative to the pursuit of personal growth. It is an excuse that will only serve to hold you back.

Focus on your uptime and rotation instead!
